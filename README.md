### First RocketU Project

Inspired by childhood memories of Waldo and Carmen Sandiago

Currently there are many bugs due to my lack of knowledge and experience.

Working on ironing out many of those bugs but I am discovering many more behind the ones I fixed.

This was way more involved than I had originally thought. Seriously I have put many more hours into this than I thought it would originally require. Ridiculous Noob Optimism which will surely continue
